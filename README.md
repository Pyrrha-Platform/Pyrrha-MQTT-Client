This repository contains the [Pyrrha](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha) solution MQTT client that receives [device](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Firmware) readings from the [mobile app](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Mobile-App) via the [IBM IoT Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform). The service then stores the data in the [database](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Database) and also sends it to the [WebSocket service](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-WebSocket-Server).

## Technologies used

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
1. [WebSocket Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers)

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following services running to use the MQTT client. The IoT platform runs on IBM Cloud. The database and websocket services can be run locally using Docker.

1. [Pyrrha MQTT Server (VerneMQ)](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Deployment-Configurations/blob/main/DOCKER_COMPOSE.md#pyrrha-mqttserver)
1. [Pyrrha Database Service](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Database)
1. [Pyrrha Websocket Server](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-WebSocket-Server)

## MQTT Server integration

In order for the MQTT Client to communicate with the MQTT broker, information for the client should be added to VerneMQ's database table. The instructions for this can be found [here](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Deployment-Configurations/blob/main/DOCKER_COMPOSE.md#pyrrha-mqttclient).

## Run locally with Node.js

You can run this solution locally as follows:

1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill out the values. The following values can be obtained from the IBM IoT platform as explained under the `Connect an application to IBM Watson IoT Platform` section [here](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha/blob/main/WATSON_IOT_SETUP.md). The `IOT_CLIENTID` needs to be of the format `a:{orgId}:{application_name}`. The `orgId` can be obtained from the IoT platform. The `application_name` can be any string.

   ```sh
    IOT_HOST=
    IOT_TOPIC=
    IOT_PROTOCOL=
    IOT_USERNAME=
    IOT_PASSWORD=
    IOT_SECURE_PORT=
    IOT_PORT=
    IOT_CLIENTID=
    IOT_PEM=
   ```

   The following values are used to store data in the database:

   ```sh
   MARIADB_HOST=
   MARIADB_USERNAME=
   MARIADB_PASSWORD=
   ```

   The following variables are used to send data to the WebSocket Server.

   ```sh
   WS_HOST=
   WS_PORT=
   ```

1. Install the dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. Start the server

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Run locally with Docker

1. Build the image

   ```sh
   docker build . -t mqttclient
   ```

1. Run the image and pass the .env file as environment variables

   ```sh
   docker run --env-file .env mqttclient
   ```

   You do not need to expose any port.
1. You should see the application logs

   ```sh
   > mqtt-client@1.0.0 start /home/upkarlidder/Documents/upkar-code/call-for-code/pyrrah/Pyrrha-MQTT-Client
   > node mqttclient.js

## Run on Kubernetes

You can run this application on Kubernetes using the charts provided in the `chart` directory. The repository also provides a skaffold.yaml file that enables quick building and pushing for faster development. Read more about Skaffold [here](https://skaffold.dev/). There are two profiles provided, `test` and `default`. To run the solution on the `test` namespace use: `skaffold dev -p test`
